# User Manager Project

This project is a simple user management system that allows you to add, edit, delete, and display users. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface and manage user data in the browser.

## Features

The User Manager project provides the following features:

- Add a user with a first name, last name, and email address.
- Edit an existing user's information.
- Delete a user from the user list.
- Display all users in a table format.
- Hide or show all users with a single button click.
- Delete all users and clear the user list.

## Usage

To use the User Manager project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. The User Manager interface will be displayed, showing a form to add new users, a table to display existing users, and buttons to show all users, delete all users, and hide/show all users.

4. To add a user, enter the user's first name, last name, and email address in the form fields and click the "Add User" button. The user will be added to the table.

5. To edit a user, click the "Edit" button next to the user's information in the table. The user's information will be populated in the form fields. Make the necessary changes and click the "Update User" button to save the changes.

6. To delete a user, click the "Delete" button next to the user's information in the table. The user will be removed from the table.

7. To display all users, click the "Show All Users" button. The table will show all the users currently in the system.

8. To hide or show all users, click the "Hide All Users" or "Show All Users" button. This will toggle the visibility of the user table.

9. To delete all users, click the "Delete All Users" button. This will remove all users from the table and clear the user list.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the user interface structure.
- `styles/style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the user interface.
- `scripts/script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the user management functionality.

## Customization

You can customize the User Manager project by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to your needs. You can change the styling, add additional fields or functionality, or integrate it into a larger application.

Please note that this project does not include server-side functionality or database integration. User data is stored in the browser's localStorage, which means the data will persist only within the browser session and will be lost if the browser cache or data is cleared.

## Dependencies

The User Manager project does not have any external dependencies. It is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which should be supported by modern web browsers.
